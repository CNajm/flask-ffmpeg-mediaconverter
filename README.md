# Project Title

Flask-FFmpeg Media Converter

## About

This is a WIP project that interfaces an audio converter powered by ffmpeg using flask, and my project for ICT 12 - October/November 2017

This was my first dive into flask and standalone back-ends.
I will be adding and improving to this in the future, but this is what I have so far.

## Built With

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org)

## Deploying

Download and extract, you will also need whatever FFmpeg binary runs on your system linked to using the FFMPEG_BIN variable.
